# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
As a Beginner level SQL learner for the first time with coding practice, My goal is to understand the logic of using sql queries to have te solution to the question. Goal is to learn 1 step at a time towards the SQL coding.
## Process
I downloaded the Database into pgadmin which was a task as pgadmin (column names should be all small to aviod errors) importing from excel as it is with correct data types for column field.

Then once my Database was correctly imported i was looking at the database to understand the tables and thier respective columns and thier reasons to be in the table. which is the hard part to understand raw data and making sesnse of ecommerce data.

Then i started only thinking of data that i ll be using to find answers to clean first as It was very time consuming for me to concentrate on each table to clean for no reason.

## Results
I understod about productSKU as Primary key cause its a unique code for products, Products table made more sense to me as as with the names of products and ordered quantity and all_sessions table has most of the data to look for Questions given like visiton on website to order products from which country and city

## Challenges 
Main challenge for me , was time to dedicate towards this project as I work full time too.
Kepp it bit more simple not to discourage beginner level students to give up witht he thought of being too lenthy (Advise)
I was discouraged too many times just looking at the depth of the data to make it more readible and clean for  using it for solving business questions but I beleive its also true to real world job scenerio. Now i have a close idea how Databas looks like in real world to begin with .


## Future Goals
I would definetly clean it more , make more sense(questions) out of it on my own pace.
